# Graphic Runner v0.0.7 Public Beta

This release gives Graphic Runner a more independent effect language with new
names, controls, palettes, and silhouettes while preserving stable internal
effect IDs for compatibility.

## Independent effect redesign

- **Ghost Plume** replaces the previous fire treatment with long cold-white
  vapor tongues, an ivory core, and plume/curl/drift controls.
- **Taffy Veil** replaces the previous slime treatment with pale elastic
  ribbons that stretch sideways rather than green hanging drips.
- **Signal Filament** replaces the previous lightning treatment with smooth
  ember-white magnetic field lines rather than blue branching bolts.
- Mirror Alloy, Solar Brass, Ribbon Alloy, Airform, Soft Resin, Spectrum Film,
  Pinlight Matrix, Offset Stack, Carbon Dust, Ember Blades, Facet Grid, Phase
  Bands, and Spectrum Laminate establish a separate naming system.
- Matching categories, parameter labels, defaults, documentation, and symbol
  names were revised as part of the same pass.

## Compatibility and retained tools

- Stable internal effect IDs remain in place for existing projects and CLI use.
- Layers, masks, Hide/Reveal brushes, selections, Type Lab, undo/redo, ICC
  proofing, PNG/GIF/CMYK TIFF export, and the Ember interface remain available.
- The complete headless render and editor smoke test passes for all 29 effects.

## Downloads

- `GraphicRunnerInstallBeta.exe` — recommended for most testers
- `GraphicRunnerInstallBeta.msi` — managed or advanced installation

The installers are not yet digitally signed. Download only from the official
`RunnerLabs/graphic-runner` repository, verify the checksum, then use **More
info → Run anyway** if Microsoft Defender SmartScreen appears.

## Linux through Bottles and Wine

The Windows installer has been successfully tested on Linux through Bottles
using its Wine runner. This remains a compatibility setup, not a native Linux
build.
