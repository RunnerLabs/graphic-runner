# Graphic Runner

Graphic Runner is an offline desktop graphics studio for creating high-impact text, logo, symbol, and motion effects. The public beta is free to use for personal and commercial design work under the included license.

## Download

Download the latest self-contained build from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/trunninthisshit/graphic-runner/releases/latest).

- `GraphicRunner-Next-win-x64.zip` is the Windows 10/11 x64 build.
- `GraphicRunner-Next-linux-x64.tar.gz` is the native Linux x64 build.
- No separate Java or .NET installation is required.

## Windows installation

1. Download `GraphicRunner-Next-win-x64.zip` from the latest release.
2. Verify its SHA-256 checksum against the value below.
3. Extract the ZIP.
4. Open the extracted folder and run `GraphicRunner.Next.exe`.
5. Because this beta is not yet digitally signed, Windows may show **Windows protected your PC**. After verifying the checksum, select **More info**, confirm the app name, and select **Run anyway**.
6. Accept the beta license when Graphic Runner opens.

Do not disable Microsoft Defender or SmartScreen. A trusted code-signing identity is the permanent fix for the unsigned-publisher warning.

## Linux installation

Graphic Runner now includes a native self-contained Linux x64 build. Wine and Bottles are not required.

1. Download `GraphicRunner-Next-linux-x64.tar.gz` from the latest release.
2. Verify its SHA-256 checksum against the value below.
3. Extract and launch it:

```bash
tar -xzf GraphicRunner-Next-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd linux-x64
chmod +x GraphicRunner.Next
./GraphicRunner.Next
```

A desktop session with the usual font, X11/Wayland, and graphics libraries is required.
